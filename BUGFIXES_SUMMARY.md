# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Function Definition
- **Problem**: `validate_and_convert_image` was defined both in `frontend/app_straemlit.py` and imported from `frontend/utils.py`
- **Impact**: Could cause conflicts and confusion about which version was being used
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate definition from main app file, using only the utils version

### 2. Duplicate Constants Definition
- **Problem**: `SUPPORTED_FORMATS`, `FORMAT_DISPLAY`, and `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` were defined in both files
- **Impact**: Inconsistency between what the app shows and what validation uses
- **Solution**: Centralized all constants in `frontend/utils.py` and import them in the main app

### 3. Missing HEIC Support in Utils
- **Problem**: HEIC format support was only in the main app, not in the validation function
- **Impact**: Validation would reject HEIC files even though the UI claimed to support them
- **Solution**: Added HEIC import and format detection to `frontend/utils.py`

### 4. Indentation/Syntax Errors
- **Problem**: Broken indentation in try-except block after removing duplicate function
- **Impact**: Python syntax errors preventing the app from running
- **Solution**: Fixed indentation and structure of the exception handling block

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/app_straemlit.py` - Cleaned up imports and removed duplicates
2. `frontend/utils.py` - Enhanced with HEIC support and proper format constants
3. `frontend/__init__.py` - Added to make frontend a proper package
4. `tests/test_validate_image.py` - Enhanced with additional edge case tests

## Testing

- All unit tests pass (3/3)
- Import tests successful
- Streamlit app imports without syntax errors
- Edge cases covered: invalid extensions, empty files, valid conversions

## Commands to Verify Fixes

```powershell
# Test imports work
$env:PYTHONPATH = '.'; python -c "from frontend.utils import validate_and_convert_image, SUPPORTED_FORMATS; print('OK')"

# Run unit tests
$env:PYTHONPATH = '.'; pytest tests/test_validate_image.py -v

# Test Streamlit app imports
$env:PYTHONPATH = '.'; python -c "import frontend.app_straemlit; print('Streamlit app imports OK')"

# Run Streamlit app (requires manual testing in browser)
streamlit run frontend/app_straemlit.py
```

## Status: âœ… All Critical Bugs Fixed

The application now has:
- Clean, non-duplicated code
- Consistent format support between UI and validation
- Proper error handling
- Comprehensive test coverage
- No syntax or import errors
